### Standalone React Component Development Kit


This is a basic setup to help working on standalone React components.

It's based on [React Component Starter](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-component-starter), which hadn't been updated in nearly a year as of when I started on this repo (April 2016).

Feel free to make suggestions or PRs. I created this mainly for my own use, but if you find it helpful, great!
